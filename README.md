This multi-page project is implemented in an object-oriented programming style. The aim of the project was to work with class constructions, properties, inheritance, execution context 'this'. I worked with the finished layout. The project has not yet completed functionality with buttons and modal windows.
In the project, I worked with:
- sliders (the whole project consists of 6 large slides, an arrow button on the left bottom; there are also small slides inside).
- Youtube API
- collapse elements
(located on page 2, cards are added to the difference block).
- loading elements
- forms 
- phone number mask
- elements that appear over time

The site is adaptive only for desktop.
